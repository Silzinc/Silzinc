- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Silzinc
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in (in order) physics, maths, cooking, algorithms
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning all of these at school for the two formers and by myself for the two latters
- ðŸ“« How to reach me:
  1. By discord at `.silfer` (Silfer is my original pseudo. "Fer" is the French for "iron" and "zinc" is just another metal)
  2. I have yet to make another email address for that one
